What is Image processing using open CV?
Image Processing using OpenCV refers to the set of techniques and operations applied to images to enhance, modify, or analyze them. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is one of the most widely used libraries for computer vision tasks and provides a rich set of functions for handling image processing tasks in Python, C++, and other programming languages.

Image processing using OpenCV involves manipulating and analyzing images to extract useful information, detect objects, transform images, and more. OpenCV supports a wide variety of functions and operations that allow you to perform complex image processing tasks such as edge detection, object recognition, feature extraction, image enhancement, and more.

Install the required packages:

pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
Usage
Update the image path in the code:

python

image_path = 'path_to_your_image.jpg'
Run the script:

python image_processing.py
The original and processed images will be displayed.
